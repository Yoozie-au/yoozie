A cultural and educational gem on the Central Coast! The Gallery hosts local, national and international exhibitions.

The Gallery holds family activities during school holiday periods, so it's a great place for the whole family.

The Gallery has an onsite shop and a cafe, so be sure to stop by at both for some snacks and a souvenir!

Admission into the Gallery is free of charge, but donations are welcomed.
