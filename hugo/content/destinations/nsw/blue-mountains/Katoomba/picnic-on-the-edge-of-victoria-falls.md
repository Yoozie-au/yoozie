Victoria Falls is a wild romantic terrain that requires moderate fitness to undertake its breathtaking mountain track. 

The track is full of live animals and especially the great yellow-tailed black cockatoos.

Enjoy the serenity of the place by bringing a picnic rug and lunch and relax in the shade of the lush canopy.
