The pool of Siloam is a serene water view starting with a waterfall and ends up with a waterhole in Leura at the upper side of Blue Mountains.

It is an incredible place to spend the time with friends and family as it accommodates picnic areas, artificial caves, public toilets, electric barbecue stations and lot more.

The majestic waterfall is hedged by a natural channel and sandstone cliffs. The sandy water makes a convenient and safe place for children to swim, splash and play.
