Avalon restaurant offers more than 80 Australian wine, spirits and craft beers focusing on local produce, mainly on the central ranges, west of the Blue Mountains. 

The restaurant has daily new special dishes to try from with a comprehensive menu but the main dishes were almost kept the same for the last 32 years due to its mouthwatering taste that kept their guests loyal to it all this time.
