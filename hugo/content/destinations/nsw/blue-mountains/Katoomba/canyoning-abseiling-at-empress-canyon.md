Empress Canyon takes you on a great adventure starting with abseiling in the morning till lunch time where a delightful lunch is offered to you, then a 20 min walk that leads you to the start of the canyon and goes down the creek to finally jump into a rock pool where you can enjoy a nice cool swim.
