Jellybean Pool is located around 2km from the Glenbook Entrance. The pool has a wonderful walking track which is worth the try for any Sydney visitors or for people staying in the Blue Mountains area.

The pool was called Jellybean due to its shape that looks almost like an actual Jellybean.

A carpark is within close proximity of the pool with an approximately 200 meters walk.
