Minnehaha Falls (or Minno-Ha-Ha Falls) is located in Katoomba, known for its splendid water fall view and its swimming pond at the bottom of the fall.

There is a carpark near by the waterfall that is only around 20 minutes walk with some side stops overlooking some stunning views.

The carpark in summer can get filled very quickly, therefore we recommend to come in first hours of the morning.
