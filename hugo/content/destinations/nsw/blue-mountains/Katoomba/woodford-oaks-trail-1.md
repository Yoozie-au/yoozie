The Woodford Oaks trail is in Blue Mountains National Park and extends from Woodford to Glenbrook and makes an ideal mountain bike's track.

The track takes your breath away with its amazing forestry views. The Oaks picnic area is a great resting place to enjoy a quiet lunch. 

In the warmer months, the aroma of wildflowers and eucalypts mingle to create a heady perfume. Itâ€™s also a very popular track for cyclists and runners, and attracts over 850 participants for the annual Woodford to Glenbrook Classic.
